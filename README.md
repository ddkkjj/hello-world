# hello-world
I want to be alert and smart.
So I would like to read as many books as possible,
to involve as much knowledge as possible,
though I am totally a rookie in some fields.
But I must make a living at first.
I never manage to do anything well through my own efforts.
I am breathing with a lack of confidence,
paralyzing myself while swimming in the ocean of knowledge.
